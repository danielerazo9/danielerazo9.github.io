                Hello! My name is <strong>Daniel Erazo</strong> and I am a first year <em>Computer Engineering</em> major.
            </p>
            <p>I am from Modesto, CA. I love the outdoors, trying new sports, and watching different shows. 
            My favorite show of all time is One Piece, but I also really like Dexter. I hope to be able to come up with cool projects
            in the future with <strong>Hack4Impact!</strong>
